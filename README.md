# SignalR Web Chat in .net Core 2.2
## A learning project

The purpose of this project is to explore and get familiar with SignalR and asynchronous C# development.
The base for this build is taken from the page [Get started with ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr?tabs=visual-studio&view=aspnetcore-2.2)

Things I want to add to this base application:
* Chat persistance on load
* Historical Chat that persists beyond application lifecycle
* User accounts, with cookie based storage originally but to progress to sql based login and authentication
